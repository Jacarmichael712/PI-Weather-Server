PI WEATHER SERVER BY JAMES CARMICHAEL

This project uses a Raspberry PI 3 B+ to create a server that will get API
info from WeatherAPI.com and show you the weather forecast in your area.

The server will passively wait for a socket connection from a client.
The client will connect to the server and request the weather forecast.
The server will get weather forecast information from the API and return
the results to the client and proceed to end the connection.

This project makes use of:
 - Server-client architecture using IPv4 sockets
 - REST API functionality
